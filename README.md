# Get the hours count of Mosh Hamedani's courses

*The courses are not mine, I've only implemented a console application where you can check the total time of a particular course in **https://codewithmosh.com/***

## How to use:
- Download the project 
- Install **requests**
- Open terminal and execute this command:
- - **python getHours.py *linkToMoshPage*** 

## Examples: 
- If you've enrolled in the course:
- - python getHours.py https://codewithmosh.com/courses/enrolled/783424 
- - After **enrolled/** you need to put the code number of the course you want to check
- If you've not enrolled in the course:
- - python getHours.py https://codewithmosh.com/p/ultimate-redux 
- - You need to put the direct link to the course preview

Enjoy!
